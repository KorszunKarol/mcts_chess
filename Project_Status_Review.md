# Project Status and Comparison with Design Document

This document summarizes the work completed on the chess engine project and compares the current implementation against the `AlphaZero Engine Implementation Review_.md` design document.

## I. Summary of Completed Work

The project has successfully implemented a sophisticated, high-performance, asynchronous MCTS engine. The core architecture is robust, scalable, and aligns with modern best practices for this type of application.

### Key Implemented Components:

1.  **Asynchronous MCTS Engine (`src/mcts/`)**:
    *   **Process-Based Parallelism**: The engine is built on Python's `multiprocessing` module to bypass the GIL and achieve true parallelism for the CPU-bound MCTS search.
    *   **Orchestration**: A central `MCTSController` class manages the entire lifecycle of the engine, including setup, process creation, and graceful shutdown.
    *   **Hybrid IPC**: A high-performance, hybrid Inter-Process Communication (IPC) system is in place:
        *   **Data Plane**: `multiprocessing.shared_memory` is used for zero-copy transfer of large NumPy arrays (NN inputs/outputs) between processes, minimizing latency. A pool of shared memory blocks is created and managed by the controller.
        *   **Control Plane**: `multiprocessing.Queue` is used for lightweight message passing to coordinate tasks and results.
    *   **Dedicated GPU Process**: A single `EvaluationManager` process manages the GPU and the neural network model, performing inference on batches of positions sent from the search workers.
    *   **Independent Search Workers**: Multiple `SearchWorker` processes execute the MCTS algorithm. Each worker runs an independent search for a given position, ensuring no contention or synchronization overhead for the MCTS tree itself.

2.  **Advanced Search Algorithm (`src/mcts/node.py`, `src/mcts/worker.py`)**:
    *   **Search-Contempt MCTS**: The engine implements the advanced Search-Contempt algorithm. The `MCTSNode` data structure correctly maintains the necessary state (`depth`, `is_frozen`, `frozen_visit_counts`), and the selection logic properly switches between standard PUCT for the player and a Thompson-sampling-based approach for the opponent.

3.  **Neural Network (`src/model.py`)**:
    *   **Dual-Head Model**: A standard dual-head neural network has been implemented in TensorFlow/Keras, with a shared "body" and separate "value" and "policy" heads.

4.  **Bootstrap Training Framework (`train.py`, `src/training/losses.py`)**:
    *   **Training Script**: A `train.py` script is available to run an initial "warm-start" training from human-expert games in PGN format.
    *   **Dual-Head Loss**: A correct, weighted, dual-head loss function has been implemented.
    *   **Basic Monitoring**: The training script is configured to use the `tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard` callback to log essential model metrics like losses and weight distributions.

## II. Comparison with `AlphaZero Engine Implementation Review_.md`

This section compares the current state of the codebase against the specific sections of the design document.

| Section from Design Document | Status | Alignment with Design & Key Observations |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. The High-Performance Asynchronous MCTS Engine** | ✅ **Complete & Aligned** | The implementation in `src/mcts/` is an excellent realization of this design. It correctly uses `multiprocessing`, the hybrid IPC architecture with `shared_memory`, and the "no shared tree" approach. The code is well-structured with `Controller`, `Manager`, and `Worker` roles. |
| **II. Implementing Search-Contempt MCTS** | ✅ **Complete & Aligned** | The implementation is correct and complete. The `MCTSNode` class contains the required state, and the selection logic in `select_child` perfectly matches the asymmetric search strategy described. |
| **III. Bootstrapping the Network: A "Warm Start"** | ⚠️ **Partially Implemented** | **Alignment**: The `train.py` script, `create_model`, and `create_combined_loss` function are all present and correct. <br> **Deviation**: The **PGN parsing and `tf.data` pipeline (`create_dataset` function) appears to be missing**. The import in `train.py` is a dangling reference, and the `src/data` directory does not exist. This is a critical missing piece for the bootstrapping phase. |
| **IV. High-Throughput Data Storage (Replay Buffer)** | ❌ **Not Implemented** | **Deviation**: The design strongly recommends **TFRecord** for the replay buffer to ensure high I/O performance during self-play training. There is currently **no implementation of a replay buffer**, no code for writing to or reading from TFRecord files, and no self-play loop that would generate this data. |
| **V. Comprehensive Training & Performance Monitoring** | ⚠️ **Partially Implemented** | **Alignment**: Basic model-specific monitoring (losses, histograms) is correctly implemented via the Keras `TensorBoard` callback in `train.py`. <br> **Deviation**: The critical **ELO rating evaluation protocol is missing**. The design calls for a dedicated evaluator to run matches between model checkpoints, calculate ELO, and log it to TensorBoard. The existing `src/evaluator.py` is a utility for evaluating single positions, not a harness for evaluating model strength. This means there is currently no way to measure true progress. |

## III. Next Steps & Recommendations

The foundation of the project—the asynchronous MCTS engine—is exceptionally well-built and matches the design specification perfectly. The project is in a strong position.

The immediate priorities should be to address the missing components:

1.  **Re-implement the Data Pipeline**: Re-create the `create_dataset` function for parsing PGN files and feeding them into the training script. This is required to make `train.py` functional. The implementation should follow the design's recommendation of using a `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator`.
2.  **Implement the Replay Buffer**: Design and implement the replay buffer using the **TFRecord** format as recommended. This will involve creating functions to serialize training examples and write them to sharded TFRecord files.
3.  **Build the Self-Play Loop**: Create the main orchestration loop that:
    *   Uses the MCTS controller to play games against itself.
    *   Stores the generated `(state, policy, outcome)` data in the TFRecord replay buffer.
    *   Periodically initiates training runs on data sampled from the replay buffer.
4.  **Build the ELO Evaluator**: Implement the evaluation harness described in Section V. This process should periodically take the latest model checkpoint, play a large number of games against the current best model, calculate the new ELO rating, and log it to TensorBoard. This is the only way to get a true signal of the engine's progress.
